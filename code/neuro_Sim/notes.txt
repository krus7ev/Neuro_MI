SETUP NOTES:

->  average poisson rate noise final settings  :=  moderate noise simillar to currrent one

->  good tau value for the van Rossum metric   :=  12ms for best clustering [Narayan.2006]

->  good q [ms] value move-cost V-P metric     :=  q=2/12

->  deviation from regression line quantifier  :=  pearson coeff

->  connectivity inference strategies          :=  measure all pairwise MIs and see if expextable 


TO CODE:

-> put all plots one graph (exp2)

-> Make legends (exp2 - add mean and pearson coeff)
-> optimise: use np.arrays wherever possible

EXTRAS:

-> make the whole thing like a proper command line tool with options - for different simulations/parameters (and defaults as well)
   and add some more terminal feedback about the process too


TO WRITE/EDIT:

>Background
-> introduce Bucket equation directly - drop bucket analogy
-> clarify the section on poisson neurons: determinism in rich topology ~ randomness

>Experiment


>Implementation


>Results


>Conclusion
