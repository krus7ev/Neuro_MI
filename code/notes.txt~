>>>>>FINISH AND SUBMIT NEUROSCIENCE ASSIGNMENT 1<<<<<


QUESTIONS:

->  What would be good settings for the randomness/noise in the average fire rate of Poisson neurons?

->  What is a good tau value for the van Rossum metric? 
    //Different tau gives different metric and different clusteres [e.g. Narayan.2006 => 12ms for best clustering]//

->  What is a good value for q - the moving-cost [ms] factor for Victor Purpura metric?

->  Aren't we interested in the deviations from the overall tendency - e.g. the least-squares regression line??

->  Aren't we interested in seeing how it does on the clustering task?


TO CODE:
  
-> make the whole thing like a proper command line tool with options - for different simulations/parameters (and defaults as well)
   and add some more terminal feedback about the process too
 
-> the clustering task


TO WRITE:

-> introduce Bucket equation directly - drop bucket analogy


-> clarify the section on poisson neurons: determinism in rich topology ~ randomness

-> see if will be using synapse-like vR metric and remove if necessary
   see if will be implementing efficient (linear-time) vR computation and elaborate if nessesary

-> see if will be giving a working example using Earth-mover Distance for images and edit Background chapter accordingly


-> PLAN & START chapter on code and implementation

   -? level of detail of code description / commenting etc.

-> PLAN & START chapter on experiments results analysis conclusions
