>>>>>FINISH AND SUBMIT NEUROSCIENCE ASSIGNMENT 1<<<<<


QUESTIONS:

-  How to properly set the average fire rate randomness/noise ?

-  What is a good tau values for for van Rossum metric? 
   Different tau give different metrics and different clusteres [Narayan.2006 := 12ms best clustering]

-  What is a good value for q - cost factor for Victor Purpura metric ?

-  Aren't we interested in the deviations from the overall tendency - i.e. regression line??


TO CODE:
  
- FIX PLOTS: 
    * PUT LABELS, 
    * get rid of double plt libs
    * TIDY UP 

- make the whole thing like a proper command line tool with options - for different simulations/parameters (and defaults as well)
  and add some more terminal feedback about the process too
 
 
 
TO WRITE:

- see if will be using synapse-like vR metric and remove if necessary
  see if will be implementing efficient (linear-time) vR computation and elaborate on it

---> see if will be giving a working example using Earth-mover Distance and edit background accordingly

---> introduce Bucket equation directly - drop bucket analogy

---> clarify the section on poisson neurons: determinism in rich topology ~ randomness


---> PLAN & START chapter on code and implementation

---> PLAN & START chapter on experiments results analysis conclusions
